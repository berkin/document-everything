# Raw Cashew Milk | Cashew Nut Milk Recipe
## unsweetened cashew milk:

-   1 cup [raw cashews], [soaked for 2 hours]
-   3 cups filtered water 
-   Pinch of [Celtic sea salt]

## sweetened milk (unsweetened milk, plus below):

-   1 teaspoon [natural vanilla extract ]
-   3 to 6 pitted dates, 2 to 3 tablespoons [pure maple syrup], or other
    sweetener
-   1 tablespoon [sunflower lecithin] (optional)

## chocolate milk (sweetened milk, plus below):

-   2 tablespoons [cacao powder], plus more to taste 

## cinnamon milk (sweetened milk, plus below):

-   1 teaspoon [ground cinnamon], plus more to tasteâ€‹

## strawberry milk (sweetened milk, plus below):

-   2 cups fresh strawberries, plus more to taste

1.  To soak the cashews, place the nuts in a glass or ceramic bowl or
    large glass jar, and cover with filtered water. Add 1 teaspoon
    [Celtic sea salt] and splash of fresh lemon juice or [apple cider
    vinegar], cover the container with a breathable kitchen towel, and
    allow to soak at room temperature for 2 hours. (For more information
    on soaking read [here][soaked for 2 hours].)
2.  Drain, and discard the soaking liquid (do not use this to make the
    milk). Rinse the cashews several times to remove the anti-nutrients
    and enzyme inhibitors.
3.  Throw the rinsed cashews, water, and salt in your blender, with any
    additions (if using), and blast on high for about 60 seconds, until
    smooth and creamy. (There is no need to strain.)
4.  Store the milk in a sealed container in the fridge. Activated cashew
    milk (made with [soaked cashews][soaked for 2 hours]) will keep for
    2 to 3 days in a very cold fridge. Unsoaked cashew milk will keep
    for about 5 days.
